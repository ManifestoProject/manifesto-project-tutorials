### tidytext format

The tidy text format is inspired by the tidy data format [@wickham2014]. Data is tidy if

- each variable is a column
- each observation is a row
- each type of observational unit is a table

The tidy text format picks up these three principles. Tidy text is format where information is stored in a table 
 "table with one-token-per-row" [@silge2016]. This is in contrast to the idea of term-document or document-feature matrices.

The advantage of the tidy text format is that it allows users the user of many R operations that are known from other data manipulation and data management tasks.

The tidytext package provides functions to transform several other data formats into a tidy text format. 
These functions can also be applied to the Manifesto Corpus format.

```{r}
de2013 <- mp_corpus(countryname == "Germany" & date == 201309) %>%
   tidy() %>% unnest_tokens(text,text)
   
```
